# Rest API using NodeJS, Express and MySQL database

## Steps to execute
- Clone the repo or download the repo zip.
- Install all the node modules by running the command - ```npm i```
- If you have XAMPP or any other localhost server, create a database called 'node_rest_api' or you can create your own and replace with that in the code.
- To replicate the schema, just import the sql file provided.
- You are ready to go, now just run - ```node index.js```. You should be having your server running at port 3000 on the '/api' route.
